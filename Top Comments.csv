It doesn’t even matter.
"New arena, new you. Go get that new personal best."
"This is going to sound greedy, but I'm gonna miss being top 10/30 in BA/PA. The jewels were fun while they lasted."
hopefully can avoid pairing with those mafia & hardcore PVP people that willing to burn a lot of jewels without worrying the cost of it
Top hundred arena shuffle ~♪
"I am ok with it, I been stuck at around 140-180 since the beginning... so it doesn't even matter."
"Do we get jewels for new ""best"" again?"
Wait... Is it happening today?
The best i got is 4 (i got no answer or have no attempt left to experiment against halloween misogi) then people keep pummeling me to 60-90.
Top 5 every day ( ･ิω･ิ)
I literally just spent a couple minutes shuffling through trying to find Arena Matches I could even hope to beat. My best team is just under 60k power. Everyone I'm seeing is at 70-90k power :/ no more Arena for me. . .
